In this article, we’ll discuss the six most common state management techniques that are available when working with ASP.NET Core MVC:

1. View State: This technique is used to store data as hidden values in the page markup generated by a web form. It stores all changes made to controls on the page, their values, and hidden fields in the page markup. The technique is typically used for smaller amounts of data as the size of View State is directly related to the amount of information stored.

2. Control State: This technique is similar to View State, but it is used to store control-level state information instead of view-level state information. It stores data related to individual controls as hidden fields in the page markup.

Control state is similar to View State as it stores user-entered data as a hidden field. However, it does not require view state to be enabled and, as such, can be used when View State has been disabled. Besides, it is generally used for smaller amounts of data as well.

3. Query Strings: These are strings of text that are appended to a URL as parameters. They can be used to store data and pass it between pages. Query strings are part of the URL that can be used to pass information from one page to another. This technique is limited as it is not as secure as other options, as the information passed in Query Strings can often be viewed directly in the address bar and, as such, should only be used for smaller amounts of data.

4. Cookies: These are small text files stored on the user’s computer, usually as part of their browser session. They can be used to store data as well as track user activity. Cookies are small pieces of data stored as part of the user’s browser session. This technique is often used for bigger amounts of data as cookies can store up to 4kB of information. However, this data will be sent with every request made by the client; hence it should not be used for sensitive information.

5. Sessions: This technique stores data as part of the user’s session, allowing it to be accessed from any page during the same browser session. It is the most reliable way to store data as part of a user’s activity as it does not rely on other methods such as cookies or query strings. Session state can be used for both small and large amounts of data as the size of Session State is only limited by the amount of memory available on the server.

6. Application-level State: This technique stores data as part of the application’s state, allowing it to be accessed from any page in the application. It is a useful way to store global information as part of an ASP.NET Core MVC application. Application State is similar to Session State as it is a server-side storage mechanism.

However, Application State can be used by multiple users as the information stored in Application State is available to all users. This technique should only be used for smaller amounts of data, as the amount of data stored in the Application state will affect the application’s performance.

Types of State Management in ASP.NET Core MVC

There are two major types of state management in ASP.NET:

1. Server-side State Management
Server-side state management is the process of storing user preferences and other information on the server. This type of state management is best used when a large amount of data needs to be stored, as it allows for quick access and retrieval. Examples of server-side state management techniques include using session variables, application variables, cookies, and database storage.

2. Client-side State Management

Client-side state management is the process of storing user preferences and other information on the client side, as opposed to the server. This type of state management is best used when a small amount of data needs to be stored as it allows for faster access and retrieval. Examples of client-side state management techniques include using query strings, hidden fields, and view state.

3. Understanding state management

Before diving into the techniques, it’s important to understand what state management is and why it is used. State management refers to storing user-specific data as they navigate your website or application. These include tracking user logins, creating unique sessions for each user, and managing any temporary data that can be used as the user moves through your website or application.

State management is important as it allows you to provide users with a custom experience as they navigate and interact with your website or application. It also helps improve the security of your system as certain data can be stored in a secure environment instead of being sent across the internet on every request.

What is the difference between ASP.NET and .NET?

ASP.NET is a web development framework part of the Microsoft .NET family of software development platforms and tools. It allows developers to create dynamic websites, web applications, and services using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages like C# and Visual Basic .NET (VB.Net).

On the other hand, .NET as a whole is a software framework that provides developers with libraries, compilers, and runtime environments to create and execute applications. .NET as a whole is much larger than just ASP.NET as there are multiple language options such as C++, F#, Python, and much more. In addition, it also has platforms for desktop development (Windows Forms), mobile development (Xamarin), and more.

When you hire a .NET Core Development Company, as Saigon Technology, they will have the knowledge to leverage both ASP.NET as well as other aspects of the .NET framework as needed for your project.

Final Thoughts
In conclusion, effective state management is crucial for creating successful web applications with ASP.NET Core MVC as it helps to ensure that data is stored safely and securely. Saigon Technology has extensive experience in .NET Core development and can help you develop an application using specific state management techniques as needed for your project.

1. Understanding Statelessness in Web Applications
	A.Before diving into state management, it’s essential to understand that the HTTP protocol, which underpins web communication, is stateless. This means:

	B.No Memory of Past Interactions: Each HTTP request is independent. The server doesn’t retain information about previous requests from the same client Challenges: This statelessness poses challenges when building web applications that require persistence of user data across multiple pages or interactions.

2. Why State Management is Important
State management bridges the gap caused by the stateless nature of HTTP, enabling web applications to:

Maintain User Sessions: Keep track of user interactions and preferences.
Personalize Experiences: Provide tailored content based on user data.
Handle Data Across Requests: Persist data like shopping cart contents or form inputs across multiple requests.
Tip: Effective state management enhances user experience by making web applications feel more interactive and responsive.

3. Types of State Management
State management techniques in ASP.NET Core can be broadly categorized into:

Client-Side State Management
Data Stored on the Client: Information is stored on the user’s browser.
Techniques Include: Query strings, hidden fields, cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage.
Server-Side State Management
Data Stored on the Server: Information is maintained on the server, often associated with a unique client identifier.
Techniques Include: Session state, TempData, and caching.

Choosing the Right Method: The selection depends on factors like security requirements, data size, persistence duration, and application architecture.

4. Client-Side State Management Techniques
Query Strings
What Are They?
Query strings are key-value pairs appended to the URL, allowing data to be passed between pages.

Example: https://www.example.com/products/details?id=1&productName=Phone

Implementation
File: /Controllers/ProductController.cs

[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Details(int id, string productName)
{
    // Use the query string parameters
    ViewData["ProductId"] = id;
    ViewData["ProductName"] = productName;
    return View();
}
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Simple to use.
No server resources needed.
Cons:

Visible to users (security concerns).
Limited length.
Data can be tampered with.
Tip: Use query strings for non-sensitive data, like sorting options or page numbers.

Hidden Fields
What Are They?
Hidden fields are form inputs that are not displayed to the user but store data within forms.

File: /Views/Product/Edit.cshtml

<form method="post" action="/products/update">
    <input type="hidden" name="ProductId" value="@Model.ProductId" />
    <!-- Other form fields -->
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Easy to implement.
Maintains state across form submissions.
Cons:

Data can be viewed and modified via browser developer tools.
Tip: Validate hidden field data on the server to prevent tampering.

Cookies
What Are They?
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client machine, sent with every HTTP request to the server.

File: /Controllers/UserController.cs

[HttpPost]
public IActionResult SetUserPreferences(string theme)
{
    CookieOptions options = new CookieOptions
    {
        Expires = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(30),
        Secure = true, // Ensures cookie is only sent over HTTPS
        HttpOnly = true, // Not accessible via JavaScript
    };
    Response.Cookies.Append("UserTheme", theme, options);
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}

[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Index()
{
    var userTheme = Request.Cookies["UserTheme"] ?? "default";
    ViewData["Theme"] = userTheme;
    return View();
}
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Persistent storage across sessions.
Useful for personalization.
Cons:

Limited storage capacity (~4KB).
Potential security risks if not handled properly.
Security Tip:

Set Secure and HttpOnly flags.
Consider using SameSite attribute to prevent CSRF attacks.
LocalStorage and SessionStorage
What Are They?
localStorage and sessionStorage are Web Storage APIs that allow storing data in the browser.

localStorage: Data persists even after the browser is closed.
sessionStorage: Data persists only for the duration of the page session.
Implementation
// Storing data
localStorage.setItem("userTheme", "dark");
sessionStorage.setItem("sessionId", "abc123");

// Retrieving data
var theme = localStorage.getItem("userTheme");
var sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem("sessionId");
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Larger storage capacity (~5MB).
Data not sent with every HTTP request.
Cons:

Accessible via JavaScript (potential XSS vulnerabilities).
Not suitable for sensitive data.
Use Case Tip: Use for storing non-sensitive data like user preferences or UI settings.

5. Server-Side State Management Techniques
Session State
What Is It?
Session state allows storing user data on the server, associated with a unique session ID.

Setup in Program.cs

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20);
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseSession();
Implementation
File: /Controllers/AccountController.cs

public IActionResult Login(string username)
{
    // Store data in session
    HttpContext.Session.SetString("Username", username);
    return RedirectToAction("Dashboard");
}

public IActionResult Dashboard()
{
    // Retrieve data from session
    var username = HttpContext.Session.GetString("Username");
    ViewData["Username"] = username;
    return View();
}
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Secure storage on the server.
Suitable for sensitive information.
Cons:

Consumes server memory.
Not scalable without distributed session management.
Scalability Tip: Use a distributed cache like Redis for session storage in load-balanced environments.

TempData
What Is It?
TempData is a dictionary for storing data that needs to persist between requests, especially during redirects.

Implementation
File: /Controllers/ProductController.cs

public IActionResult Create()
{
    TempData["Message"] = "Product created successfully!";
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}

public IActionResult Index()
{
    ViewBag.Message = TempData["Message"];
    return View();
}
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Ideal for short-lived data like notifications.
Cons:

Data persists only until read.
Not suitable for long-term storage.
Use Case Tip: Use TempData for success or error messages after form submissions.

Cache
What Is It?
Caching involves storing frequently accessed data in memory to improve application performance.

Setup in Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();
Implementation
File: /Controllers/ProductController.cs

private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

public ProductController(IMemoryCache cache)
{
    _cache = cache;
}

public IActionResult GetProducts()
{
    const string cacheKey = "productList";
    if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<Product> products))
    {
        products = _dbContext.Products.ToList();
        var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions
        {
            AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)
        };
        _cache.Set(cacheKey, products, cacheEntryOptions);
    }
    return View(products);
}
Pros and Cons
Pros:

Reduces database load.
Improves application responsiveness.
Cons:

Cached data may become outdated.
Requires cache invalidation strategies.
Best Practice Tip: Implement cache invalidation when the underlying data changes.

6. Best Practices for State Management
Security First:

Never store sensitive data on the client side.
Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Implement proper validation and sanitization.
Minimize Statefulness:

Design stateless APIs where possible for scalability.
Use tokens (like JWT) for authentication instead of session state.
Manage Resources:

Be cautious with server memory when using sessions.
Set appropriate timeouts and cleanup mechanisms.
Consistent User Experience:

Ensure that state management enhances, not hinders, the user experience.
Handle state-related errors gracefully.
Scalability Considerations:

For server-side state, consider distributed caches for load-balanced applications.
